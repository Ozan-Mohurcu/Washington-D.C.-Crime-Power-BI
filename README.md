## Project Overview

Crime in Washington D.C. follows a clear patternâ€”it is not random but influenced by time, location, and type. This analysis highlights when and where crimes happen the most, the efficiency of law enforcement, and the severity of reported offenses. By understanding these patterns, we can take steps to enhance public safety and improve crime response strategies.

## Data Source:
Onyx Data provided this dataset via their LinkedIn profile. It contained 29 columns and 3867 rows.
[Dataset](https://github.com/JoyIbe/Onyx-March-2025-Data-Challenge-Unveiling-the-Patterns-of-Crime-in-the-Washington-D.C./blob/609f9f1ae8e6e5fec019590c88a6518cfe525c56/Onyx%20Data%20-DataDNA%20Dataset%20Challenge%20-%20Washington%20Crimes%20Dataset%20-%20March%202025.xlsx)

## Tools and Methodology: 

1. Python: Used for cleaning the raw dataset. Performed datatype conversions, handled missing values, removed duplicates and ensured accurate standardization.

2. Power Query in Power BI: Used for further data transformation necessary for the analysis.
   
3. Power BI: Used for visualization.

## Data Processing:

Deployed Power BI DAX's functionality to create a new tables and calculate specific measures for tracking key metrics and custom visuals.

## Data Analysis:

- Overview: Gives a general look at crime trends, showing total crimes, resolution rates, and when crimes happen the most.

- Offense: Breaks down crimes into property and violent offenses, highlighting the most common crime types and how severe they are.

- Location: Maps out where crimes happen the most, identifying high-risk districts, wards, and hotspot areas in Washington, D.C.

### Crime Trends Over Time

- Most crimes occur between 10AM and 8PM, peaking in the evening.
- The day and evening shifts experience the highest crime rates, while midnight sees a decline.
- Law enforcement maintains a 92.65% clearance rate, yet 7.35% of cases remain unresolved.

### Crime by Location

- Technology Integration: Using predictive analytics and surveillance in high-crime areas can aid in crime prevention.


## Conclusion

Washington D.C.'s crime follows a structured pattern influenced by time, location, and type. While law enforcement maintains a high clearance rate, unresolved cases highlight areas for improvement. By reinforcing security in high-risk districts, optimizing patrols during peak crime hours, and leveraging technology, the city can take meaningful steps toward a safer future.
